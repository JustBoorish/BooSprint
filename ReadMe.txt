*** How to install ***

Unpack the BooSprint directory into \Data\Gui\Customized\Flash\ located in the root of your The Secret World directory, so it looks like this:

\Data\Gui\Customized\Flash\BooSprint\BooSprint.swf
\Data\Gui\Customized\Flash\BooSprint\CharPrefs.xml
\Data\Gui\Customized\Flash\BooSprint\Modules.xml
\Data\Gui\Customized\Flash\BooSprint\LICENSE.txt
\Data\Gui\Customized\Flash\BooSprint\ReadMe.txt

PLEASE NOTE: Make sure you restart your client after installing this add-on. Always restart your client when adding XML files as these only get read on load.


*** How to uninstall ***

Delete the BooSprint directory from \Data\Gui\Customized\Flash\
